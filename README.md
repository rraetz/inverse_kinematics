# Inverse Kinematics

[![Powered by the Robotics Toolbox](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/petercorke/robotics-toolbox-python/master/.github/svg/rtb_powered.min.svg)](https://github.com/petercorke/robotics-toolbox-python)

## Introduction
This repo provides solvers for inverse kinematic problems of robotic manipulators. It heavily relies on the [Robotics Toolbox for Python](https://github.com/petercorke/robotics-toolbox-python). It contains optimization-based solvers that are particularly useful with redundant manipulators.

## Installation
After downloading the repository, you can install the required Python packages with the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Check the example at the end of the [inverse_kinematics_slsqp.py](/inverse_kinematics_slsqp.py) file. You can simply run the entire file to see the solver in action.
